# Studio Mosaic Collective


Studio Mosaic is a Chicago art collective, digital media label, and independent publisher. We are an interdisciplinary group of artists crafting a space to freely collaborate, influence, and engage. Art is meant be shared. Thatâ€™s why we think of Studio Mosaic as one big art project, or a foster home for nourishing a creative lifestyle. **Learn more at [studiomosaic.org](http://www.studiomosaic.org)**
